So this code will allow you to select info on a particular agent in the MySQL database and the properties they are selling, based on the query setup in db.php. This is the simple layout you can use to pair only the data you might display on a typical page of this sort.
Entering a number of the agent_id in the $queryNum variable will present a particular set of info on an agent. It uses two indvidual SQL queries which act together to present the data...
one photo and name in one query, and the properties in another query on the site page.
